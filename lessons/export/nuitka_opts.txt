Usage: __main__.py [--module] [--run] [options] main_module.py

Options:
  --version             show program's version number and exit
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --module              Create an extension module executable instead of a
                        program. Defaults to off.
  --standalone          Enable standalone mode for output. This allows you to
                        transfer the created binary to other machines without
                        it using an existing Python installation. This also
                        means it will become big. It implies these option: "--
                        follow-imports". You may also want to use "--python-
                        flag=no_site" to avoid the "site.py" module, which can
                        save a lot of code dependencies. Defaults to off.
  --onefile             On top of standalone mode, enable onefile mode. This
                        means not a folder, but a compressed executable is
                        created and used. Defaults to off.
  --python-debug        Use debug version or not. Default uses what you are
                        using to run Nuitka, most likely a non-debug version.
  --python-flag=PYTHON_FLAGS
                        Python flags to use. Default uses what you are using
                        to run Nuitka, this enforces a specific mode. These
                        are options that also exist to standard Python
                        executable. Currently supported: "-S" (alias
                        "nosite"), "static_hashes" (do not use hash
                        randomization), "no_warnings" (do not give Python
                        runtime warnings), "-O" (alias "noasserts"). Default
                        empty.
  --python-for-scons=PYTHON_SCONS
                        If using Python3.3 or Python3.4, provide the path of a
                        Python binary to use for Scons. Otherwise Nuitka can
                        use what you run Nuitka with or a "scons" binary that
                        is found in PATH, or a Python installation from
                        Windows registry.
  --warn-implicit-exceptions
                        Enable warnings for implicit exceptions detected at
                        compile time.
  --warn-unusual-code   Enable warnings for unusual code detected at compile
                        time.
  --assume-yes-for-downloads
                        Allow Nuitka to download code if necessary, e.g.
                        dependency walker on Windows.

  Control the inclusion of modules and packages in result.:
    --include-package=PACKAGE
                        Include a whole package. Give as a Python namespace,
                        e.g. ``some_package.sub_package`` and Nuitka will then
                        find it and include it and all the modules found below
                        that disk location in the binary or extension module
                        it creates, and make it available for import by the
                        code. Default empty.
    --include-module=MODULE
                        Include a single module. Give as a Python namespace,
                        e.g. ``some_package.some_module`` and Nuitka will then
                        find it and include it in the binary or extension
                        module it creates, and make it available for import by
                        the code. Default empty.
    --include-plugin-directory=MODULE/PACKAGE
                        Include the content of that directory, no matter if
                        it's used by the given main program in a visible form.
                        Overrides all other recursion options. Can be given
                        multiple times. Default empty.
    --include-plugin-files=PATTERN
                        Include into files matching the PATTERN. Overrides all
                        other follow options. Can be given multiple times.
                        Default empty.
    --prefer-source-code
                        For already compiled extension modules, where there is
                        both a source file and an extension module, normally
                        the extension module is used, but it should be better
                        to compile the module from available source code for
                        best performance. If not desired, there is --no-
                        prefer-source-code to disable warnings about it.
                        Default off.

  Control the following into imported modules:
    --follow-stdlib     Also descend into imported modules from standard
                        library. This will increase the compilation time by a
                        lot. Defaults to off.
    --nofollow-imports  When --nofollow-imports is used, do not descend into
                        any imported modules at all, overrides all other
                        recursion options. Defaults to off.
    --follow-imports    When --follow-imports is used, attempt to descend into
                        all imported modules. Defaults to off.
    --follow-import-to=MODULE/PACKAGE
                        Follow to that module if used, or if a package, to the
                        whole package. Can be given multiple times. Default
                        empty.
    --nofollow-import-to=MODULE/PACKAGE
                        Do not follow to that module name even if used, or if
                        a package name, to the whole package in any case,
                        overrides all other options. Can be given multiple
                        times. Default empty.

  Data files for standalone/onefile mode:
    --include-package-data=PACKAGE_DATA
                        Include data files of the given package name. Can use
                        patterns. By default Nuitka does not unless hard coded
                        and vital for operation of a package. This will
                        include all non-DLL, non-extension modules in the
                        distribution. Default empty.
    --include-data-file=DATA_FILES
                        Include data files by filenames in the distribution.
                        There are many allowed forms. With '--include-data-
                        file=/path/to/file/*.txt=folder_name/some.txt' it will
                        copy a single file and complain if it's multiple. With
                        '--include-data-
                        file=/path/to/files/*.txt=folder_name/' it will put
                        all matching files into that folder. For recursive
                        copy there is a form with 3 values that '--include-
                        data-file=/path/to/scan=folder_name=**/*.txt' that
                        will preserve directory structure. Default empty.
    --include-data-dir=DATA_DIRS
                        Include data files from complete directory in the
                        distribution. This is recursive. Check '--include-
                        data-file' with patterns if you want non-recursive
                        inclusion. An example would be '--include-data-
                        dir=/path/somedir=data/somedir' for plain copy, of the
                        whole directory. All files are copied, if you want to
                        exclude files you need to remove them beforehand.
                        Default empty.

  Immediate execution after compilation:
    --run               Execute immediately the created binary (or import the
                        compiled module). Defaults to off.
    --debugger, --gdb   Execute inside a debugger, e.g. "gdb" or "lldb" to
                        automatically get a stack trace. Defaults to off.
    --execute-with-pythonpath
                        When immediately executing the created binary
                        (--execute), don't reset PYTHONPATH. When all modules
                        are successfully included, you ought to not need
                        PYTHONPATH anymore.

  Dump options for internal tree:
    --xml               Dump the final result of optimization as XML, then
                        exit.

  Code generation choices:
    --full-compat       Enforce absolute compatibility with CPython. Do not
                        even allow minor deviations from CPython behavior,
                        e.g. not having better tracebacks or exception
                        messages which are not really incompatible, but only
                        different. This is intended for tests only and should
                        not be used for normal use.
    --file-reference-choice=FILE_REFERENCE_MODE
                        Select what value "__file__" is going to be. With
                        "runtime" (default for standalone binary mode and
                        module mode), the created binaries and modules, use
                        the location of themselves to deduct the value of
                        "__file__". Included packages pretend to be in
                        directories below that location. This allows you to
                        include data files in deployments. If you merely seek
                        acceleration, it's better for you to use the
                        "original" value, where the source files location will
                        be used. With "frozen" a notation "<frozen
                        module_name>" is used. For compatibility reasons, the
                        "__file__" value will always have ".py" suffix
                        independent of what it really is.

  Output choices:
    -o FILENAME         Specify how the executable should be named. For
                        extension modules there is no choice, also not for
                        standalone mode and using it will be an error. This
                        may include path information that needs to exist
                        though. Defaults to '<program_name>' on this platform.
                        .bin
    --output-dir=DIRECTORY
                        Specify where intermediate and final output files
                        should be put. The DIRECTORY will be populated with C
                        files, object files, etc. Defaults to current
                        directory.
    --remove-output     Removes the build directory after producing the module
                        or exe file. Defaults to off.
    --no-pyi-file       Do not create a ".pyi" file for extension modules
                        created by Nuitka. This is used to detect implicit
                        imports. Defaults to off.

  Debug features:
    --debug             Executing all self checks possible to find errors in
                        Nuitka, do not use for production. Defaults to off.
    --unstripped        Keep debug info in the resulting object file for
                        better debugger interaction. Defaults to off.
    --profile           Enable vmprof based profiling of time spent. Not
                        working currently. Defaults to off.
    --graph             Create graph of optimization process. Defaults to off.
    --trace-execution   Traced execution output, output the line of code
                        before executing it. Defaults to off.
    --recompile-c-only  This is not incremental compilation, but for Nuitka
                        development only. Takes existing files and simply
                        compile them as C again. Allows compiling edited C
                        files for quick debugging changes to the generated
                        source, e.g. to see if code is passed by, values
                        output, etc, Defaults to off. Depends on compiling
                        Python source to determine which files it should look
                        at.
    --generate-c-only   Generate only C source code, and do not compile it to
                        binary or module. This is for debugging and code
                        coverage analysis that doesn't waste CPU. Defaults to
                        off. Do not think you can use this directly.
    --experimental=EXPERIMENTAL
                        Use features declared as 'experimental'. May have no
                        effect if no experimental features are present in the
                        code. Uses secret tags (check source) per experimented
                        feature.

  Backend C compiler choice:
    --clang             Enforce the use of clang. On Windows this requires a
                        working Visual Studio version to piggy back on.
                        Defaults to off.
    -j N, --jobs=N      Specify the allowed number of parallel C compiler
                        jobs. Defaults to the system CPU count.
    --lto               Use link time optimizations if available and usable
                        (MSVC, gcc >=4.6, clang). Defaults to off.
    --static-libpython=STATIC_LIBPYTHON
                        Use static link library of Python if available.
                        Defaults to auto, i.e. enabled for where we know it's
                        working.

  Tracing features:
    --quiet             Disable all information outputs, but show warnings.
                        Defaults to off.
    --show-scons        Operate Scons in non-quiet mode, showing the executed
                        commands. Defaults to off.
    --show-progress     Provide progress information and statistics. Defaults
                        to off.
    --no-progress       Disable progress bar outputs (if tqdm is installed).
                        Defaults to off.
    --show-memory       Provide memory information and statistics. Defaults to
                        off.
    --show-modules      Provide information for included modules and DLLs
                        Defaults to off.
    --show-modules-output=SHOW_INCLUSION_OUTPUT
                        Where to output --show-modules, should be a filename.
                        Default is standard output.
    --verbose           Output details of actions taken, esp. in
                        optimizations. Can become a lot. Defaults to off.
    --verbose-output=VERBOSE_OUTPUT
                        Where to output --verbose, should be a filename.
                        Default is standard output.

  Windows specific controls:
    --windows-disable-console
                        When compiling for Windows, disable the console
                        window. Defaults to off.
    --windows-icon-from-ico=ICON_PATH
                        Add executable icon. Can be given multiple times for
                        different resolutions or files with multiple icons
                        inside. In the later case, you may also suffix with
                        #<n> where n is an integer index starting from 1,
                        specifying a specific icon to be included, and all
                        others to be ignored.
    --windows-icon-from-exe=ICON_EXE_PATH
                        Copy executable icons from this existing executable
                        (Windows only).
    --windows-uac-admin
                        Request Windows User Control, to grant admin rights on
                        execution. (Windows only). Defaults to off.
    --windows-uac-uiaccess
                        Request Windows User Control, to enforce running from
                        a few folders only, remote desktop access. (Windows
                        only). Defaults to off.
    --windows-company-name=WINDOWS_COMPANY_NAME
                        Name of the company to use in Windows Version
                        information.  One of file or product version is
                        required, when a version resource needs to be added,
                        e.g. to specify product name, or company name.
                        Defaults to unused.
    --windows-product-name=WINDOWS_PRODUCT_NAME
                        Name of the product to use in Windows Version
                        information. Defaults to base filename of the binary.
    --windows-file-version=WINDOWS_FILE_VERSION
                        File version to use in Windows Version information.
                        Must be a sequence of up to 4 numbers, nothing else
                        allowed. One of file or product version is required,
                        when a version resource needs to be added, e.g. to
                        specify product name, or company name. Defaults to
                        unused.
    --windows-product-version=WINDOWS_PRODUCT_VERSION
                        Product version to use in Windows Version information.
                        Must be a sequence of up to 4 numbers, nothing else
                        allowed. One of file or product version is required,
                        when a version resource needs to be added, e.g. to
                        specify product name, or company name. Defaults to
                        unused.
